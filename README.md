## Lost and Found
Lost or Found is a Symfony Web app for reporting lost, stolen or found items with a basic matching. As soon as you lose or find something, all you have to do is update details about lost or found item in this web app. 
This will help you to find if anyone has already reported the same item as lost...

## It is also possible to
* Contact reporter if you have any clue on the reported item.
* Email will be sent to the reporter if you have a clue and leave your details.
* Report things that were lost, stolen or found.
* The user is located to optimize the matching function.

### How to start
```bash
php bin/console server:run
```
